Goal: Release the vortex.

- Vortex is released by destroying rings around him.

- Ring is destroyed when there are 30 glowy balls on him.

- Click a ring to spawn a glowy ball at the ring's bottom.

- Rings themself sometimes spawn glowy ball.

- Destroy balls by clicking on them, so the system will move faster.

- Press vortex to destroy all glowy balls on rings.

IMPORTANT: The more you spawn glowy balls, the slower they move.
Watch when are you spawning them, as they collide with other balls and get destroyed.
